# `labsparse`: Python frontend for LAbS

This repository contains a Python language frontend for the LAbS language. This
project started out as a parser, but grew to include some static analyses and
optimizations. Its ultimate goal is to replace `LAbSParse` (the current
reference implementation of the LAbS parser) and a sizeable chunk of analyses 
currently carried out by `LAbSTranslate`.
